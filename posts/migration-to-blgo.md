Title: Migration to blgo
Template: post
Comments: enabled

I'm glad to announce that all the website **has now been migrated** to my new static blog engine: [blgo](http://github.com/zlowram/blgo)!

As you might have noticed, the site has a similar style but now it has been turned into a blog (with comments via disqus, and a even cooler look), which is far more useful than before! Feel free, then, to comment in the published posts.

I hope you like it as much as I do!
