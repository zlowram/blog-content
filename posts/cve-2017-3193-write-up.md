Title: CVE-2017-3193 Write-up 
Template: post
Comments: enabled

Back in december, I discovered a vulnerability on the D-LINK DIR-850L router that allowed to execute arbitrary code on the affected device, as root. However, I could not publish anything about it until the responsible disclosure process was done, and so it is. 

The vulnerability affects the firmware version 2.07 Build 5 and earlier, and could possibly affect other D-LINK routers since they use to reuse firmware code in their devices. Additionally, it is worth saying that, with the default router configuration, the vulnerability can only be exploited from the LAN and Wi-Fi interfaces. However, if the device's remote management option is enabled, it will also be exploitable from the WAN interface.

## Details
The affected service is the management web interface, specifically the cgibin file located within the htdocs folder on the router filesystem. The vulnerability is a Stack-Based Buffer Overflow, caused by a non-controlled use of the strcat() function that allows an overwrite of the PC, and thus change the execution flow of the program, allowing arbitrary code execution.

The call to strcat that is causing the Buffer Overflow is located at the offset 0x414a20. From the arguments passed to strcat the first (destination) corresponds to the second part of the HNAP_AUTH header, and the second (source) corresponds to the content of the SOAPAction header. If the size of the content of the SOAPAction plus the second part of the HNAP_AUTH header is more than 547 bytes, it will overflow and the following 4 overwritten bytes will correspond to the stored PC within the stack.

The following request is a Proof of Concept that will cause the process to crash, by overwriting the PC with the value 0x41414141. Note that the following is a modification of a legitimate request and that not all the headers are necessary to cause the crash.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE number CVE-2017-3193, which turns out to be my first vulnerability with CVE, which makes me quite happy!

## Recommendation 
If you happen to have the vulnerable device with a vulnerable firmware version (which is very likely if you don't usually update your devices), I recommend to check whether you have the remote management option enabled and disable it as soon as possible. After that, make sure to update your device by installing the latest version of the firmware that fixes this vulnerability, which can be found in [D-LINK's official site](http://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DIR-850L).
